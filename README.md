## Overview

This project is a personal exam work that I created as part of my HTML and CSS course at **SoftUni**. I was tasked with recreating a webpage within a 2-hour time limit as part of my exam. The objective was to replicate a given photo of the webpage using only HTML and CSS. The resources provided to me included images that I was required to use in the design, while everything else was created from scratch.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my ability to:
- Build a webpage layout using HTML5 and CSS3.
- Use appropriate HTML tags and elements for structure and semantic meaning.
- Apply CSS for styling the page, including layout, typography, and responsiveness.
- Work within a limited time frame to reproduce a design.

## How it was made

1. **HTML Structure:**
   - I started by analyzing the given design and created the basic HTML structure using elements like `header`, `footer`, `section`, and `div` to organize the content.
   - The HTML was written to be semantic, ensuring that the content was appropriately structured for accessibility and SEO.

2. **CSS Styling:**
   - Using the provided images, I applied CSS to replicate the visual appearance of the design.
   - I used Flexbox for layout alignment and positioning, ensuring that the webpage would adapt to different screen sizes (responsive design).
   - Font styling, colors, spacing, and other visual elements were added according to the original design.
   
3. **Images:**
   - The images for the webpage were provided as part of the exam resources. These were properly placed and referenced in the HTML to match the design.

4. **Time Management:**
   - I successfully completed the entire project within the 2-hour time limit, ensuring that all the required elements were included and that the webpage looked as close as possible to the given design.
